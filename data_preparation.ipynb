    "Citizens who submit service requests through the 311 system in New York City are invited to give feedback on how their issue was resolved. Each survey response includes satisfaction ratings and details of the original request. In Kenya, this mirrors platforms like Huduma Kenya and eCitizen, where citizens engage government services. Such feedback helps improve service delivery, accountability and responsiveness across public agencies.\n",

If an acronym does not have a matching name, a default placeholder such as 'Unknown Agency' will be assigned.\n",

This approach maintains data completeness without distorting the original meaning. These placeholders will also enable analysis of whether the absence of specific details correlates with satisfaction levels.\n",

    "For the Dissatisfaction Reason column, missing values will be conditionally imputed. If a respondent did not select 'Strongly Disagree' in the Satisfaction Response, the missing reason will be filled with 'Not Applicable', as no dissatisfaction was indicated. However, for cases where dissatisfaction is expressed but no reason is provided, the missing value will be retained for closer inspection or careful imputation.\n"

    "A notable portion of citizens who strongly disagreed with the service experience did not specify a dissatisfaction reason, particularly in complaints involving the New York City Police Department and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Common complaint types with missing reasons include Illegal Parking, Heat/Hot Water, and Noise – Residential, suggesting that users may have felt it unnecessary to elaborate or were too frustrated to complete the form. This pattern could point to user fatigue, emotional dissatisfaction, or flaws in form design that fail to prompt for reasons effectively. Before imputing these missing values, it's valuable to recognize them as indicators of possible survey design gaps or user experience issues. To proceed with modeling, one could impute the missing reasons with a neutral placeholder like \"Reason Not Provided\" while also creating a binary flag to retain their analytical value.\n"
