    "### Deployment Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-time Prediction Service** - Deploy a production-ready API that can process individual complaint requests and return satisfaction predictions with confidence scores in real-time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User-friendly Interface** - Provide an intuitive web application that allows non-technical users to input complaint data and receive instant satisfaction predictions with explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalable Batch Processing** - Enable bulk prediction capabilities for processing multiple complaints simultaneously through CSV upload functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Serialization** - Saved trained Random Forest model with encoders using joblib for persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Development** - Built FastAPI backend with prediction endpoints, input validation, and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Web Interface Creation** - Developed Streamlit frontend with dynamic dropdowns and real-time prediction display\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration & Testing** - Connected frontend to backend API with comprehensive input validation and response formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit Application serves as the user-facing interface that provides an intuitive web-based platform for both single and batch predictions. It features dynamic dropdown menus that automatically populate complaint types based on selected agencies, real-time prediction results with confidence scores and explanations, and CSV upload functionality for bulk processing. The interface handles input validation, displays prediction summaries, and offers downloadable results, making the machine learning model accessible to non-technical users who need to assess customer satisfaction patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI Backend functions as the core prediction engine that processes incoming requests through RESTful endpoints. It handles model loading, feature extraction from raw complaint text, sentiment analysis, categorical encoding, and generates predictions with confidence scores. The API includes comprehensive error handling, input validation using Pydantic models, and provides detailed explanations for each prediction. It supports both single predictions and can be scaled for batch processing, ensuring reliable and fast response times for the Streamlit frontend while maintaining model performance and data integrity."
